## Getting Started

Welcome to Linked List Creator.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two main folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `bin`: the folder to maintain compiled output files (when the program is run in VS Code)
- `doc`: the folder to hold javadoc files

## How to Run
To run the program in the terminal navigate to the src folder and run two commands, `javac LinkedListCreator/App.java` and then `java LinkedListCreator/App`.

## Generating Documentation
To generate javadocs navigate to the doc folder (first create one if it has not been created yet) and run `javadoc ../src/LinkedListCreator/App.java`

## Version Updates
1.1 - Create a package for the App class and fix Exception warning, by removing the unnecessary exception, and constructor warning, by adding a default constructor, that arose when generating documentation in version 1.0
