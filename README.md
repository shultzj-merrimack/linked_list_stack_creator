## Getting Started

Welcome to my Linked List and Stack Creator projects.

## Folder Structure

The repository contains two folders, one for each project:

- `LinkedListCreator`: the folder that holds the original Linked List project
- `StackCreator`: the folder that holds the secondary Stack project
- `doc`: the folder to hold javadoc files

## How to Run
To see how to run each project, view the README files in their respective directories.

## Generating Documentation
To see how to generate documentation, view the README files in their respective directories.

## Version Updates
1.2 - Change package name to StackCreator.  Add a method to push sorted Linked List elements to a stack, use that method in the main method, and pop the each element to be printed back to the user in the terminal.  Remove original printing of the Linked List.  Rearrange the main method to intialize first and then perform functionality.  Add constant list length to ensure consistency.

1.1 - Create a package for the App class and fix Exception warning and constructor warning that arose when generating documentation in version 1.0
